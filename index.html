      <h3> About me </h3>
      <p>Historians consider India's modern age to have begun sometime between 1848 and 1885.
         The appointment in 1848 of Lord Dalhousie as Governor General of the East India Company set the
         stage for changes essential to a modern state. These included the consolidation and demarcation of
         sovereignty, the surveillance of the population, and the education of citizens (English
         Education Act 1835). Technological changes—among them, railways, canals, and the telegraph—were
         introduced not long after their introduction in Europe.[92][93][94][95] However, disaffection with
         the company also grew during this time, and set off the Indian Rebellion of 1857. Fed by diverse resentments
         and perceptions, including invasive British-style social reforms, harsh land taxes, and summary treatment of
         some rich landowners and princes, the rebellion rocked many regions of northern and central India and shook the
         foundations of Company rule.[96][97] Although the rebellion was suppressed by 1858, it led to the dissolution of
         the East India Company and to the direct administration of India by the British government. Proclaiming a unitary
         state and a gradual but limited British-style parliamentary system, the new rulers also protected princes and landed
         gentry as a feudal safeguard against future In the decades following, public life gradually emerged all over India,
         leading eventually to the founding of the Indian National Congress in 1885.

      <p>The rush of technology and the commercialisation of agriculture in the second half of the 19th century was marked
         by economic setbacks—many small farmers became dependent on the whims of far-away markets.[104] There was an increase
         in the number of large-scale famines,[105] and, despite the risks of infrastructure development borne by Indian taxpayers,
         little industrial employment was generated for Indians.[106] There were also salutary effects: commercial cropping,
         especially in the newly canalled Punjab, led to increased food production for internal consumption.[107] The railway
         network provided critical famine relief,[108] notably reduced the cost of moving goods,[108] and helped nascent Indian-owned
         industry.[107] After World War I, in which approximately one million Indians served,[109] a new period began.
         It was marked by British reforms but also repressive legislations, by more strident Indian calls for self-rule,
         and by the beginnings of a nonviolent movement of non-co-operation, of which Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi would become the leader
         and enduring symbol.[110] During the 1930s, slow legislative reform was enacted by the British; the Indian National Congress won
         victories in the resulting elections.</p>
